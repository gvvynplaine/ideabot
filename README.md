# ðŸ‘‹ Meet Ideabot

It's your turnâ€”what challenges would you like to see next?

Create an issue with an idea for a Noops challengeâ€”an API, theme, or puzzleâ€”and rally votes around it. When we launch the next Noops Challenge, we'll first look to see  what the community has requested.

## How it works

Create an [issue](https://github.com/noops-challenge/ideabot/issues) with your idea.

A well-written issue would have:

- Descriptive title
- Short explanation of concept (about two sentences)
- Detailed explanation that covers how the challenge would work (API or puzzle), programming concepts required, and why people might like it. If it might appeal to a particularly communityâ€”particularly one we didn't address with this set of challengesâ€”we'd love to learn about it.
- Suggestions of what sort of projects challengers could create with the Noop.

Look at any of our READMEs (like [this one for the Hexbot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot)) for reference.

The READMEs all follow a format:

- Brief description
- How it works
- What you can do
- API documentation

With this first set, we targeted challenges where new developers could start seeing results within an hour of coding, and experienced developers could see deeper results with a few hours. Where possible, we tried to be language and platform agnosticâ€”about half the APIs are best used through the terminal in any language, and the other half best experienced through the browser.

## ðŸ’¡ What can you do?

We had dozens of ideas that we did not have room for in this challenge and that we'd love to try in the futureâ€”but we're sure there are even better ideas out there!

A few ideas we didn't do (yet) but would love to see someone run with:

- **Battleship:** Classic board game would be interesting to implement as an API to play against a robot or another human.
- **Scavenger Hunt:** Clues are hidden across repositories, source code, or responses, and only the curious can find the answer.
- **Game of Telephone:** The last message is relayed from one player to another, and the result is published to everyone.
- **Mr. Potatohead:** The API returns only fragments of the final product, and the UI displays the pieces cobbled together.
- **Interactive fiction:** Write a game that happens entirely through text.
- **Glitch:** Create filters that glitch video, audio, or data.
- **Infer an object's mass:** POST a force vector, and the API returns how much it moved. Can you figure out the object's center of gravity and massâ€”and the friction of the surface?
- **Mash up any two public repos or datasets:** Gather a list of public datasets and the tools for anyone to mash them together.
- **Ridiculous programming constraints:** Code Golf is fun but it's so...pedestrian. What if you had to write a program where no function could take an argument? Or where you couldn't use any...strings.

What else can you think of? [Let us know](https://github.com/noops-challenge/ideabot/issues).
