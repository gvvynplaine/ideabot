# ðŸ‘‹ Meet Ideabot

It's your turnâ€”what challenges would you like to see next?

Create an issue with an idea for a Noops challengeâ€”an API, theme, or puzzleâ€”and rally votes around it. When we launch the next Noops Challenge, we'll first look to see  what the community has requested.

## How it works

Create an [issue](https://github.com/noops-challenge/ideabot/issues) with your idea.

A well-written issue would have:

- Descriptive title
- Short explanation of concept (about two sentences)
- Detailed explanation that covers how the challenge would work (API or puzzle), programming concepts required, and why people might like it. If it might appeal to a particularly communityâ€”particularly one we didn't address with this set of challengesâ€”we'd love to learn about it.
- Suggestions of what sort of projects challengers could create with the Noop.

Look at any of our READMEs (like [this one for the Hexbot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot)) for reference.

The READMEs all follow a format:

- Brief description
- How it works
- What you can do
- API documentation

With this first set, we targeted challenges where new developers could start seeing results within an hour of coding, and experienced developers could see deeper results with a few hours. Where possible, we tried to be language and platform agnosticâ€”about half the APIs are best used through the terminal in any language, and the other half best experienced through the browser.

## ðŸ’¡ What can you do?

We had dozens of ideas that we did not have room for in this challenge and that we'd love to try in the futureâ€”but we're sure there are even better ideas out there!

A few ideas we didn't do (yet) but would love to see someone run with:

- Battleship
- Mr Potatohead
- Game of Telephone
- Scavenger Hunt
- Interactive fiction
- Glitch
- Encrypted Hexbot
- Infer object's mass
- More Conway's Game of life.
- Ridiculous prompt generator
- Mash up any two public repos or datasets
- Ridiculous programming constraints
